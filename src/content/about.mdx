# About

I've been developing software professionally since the beginning of 2020. I've been dicking about with programming for a lot longer.

To keep the cash-money rolling, I mostly build apps with React and TypeScript. When I'm not on the clock, I'll build with whatever takes my fancy (code or otherwise). Right now, that's [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com) and plywood (as in the thin layers of veneer glued together, not this [JS library](https://plywood.imply.io/) - who knew!).

Before all of this, I was a decorated IT security professional, but that was most uninteresting.
