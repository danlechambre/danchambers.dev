# About Me

## In a nutshell...

I'm a developer and creative based in the UK. 

## What folks pay me for...

I started developing software professionally at the start of 2021. After a few projects it was clear I had a penchant for front-end. As a result I mostly build apps with React and TypeScript and have fell completely in love with the JS ecosystem and the web platform.

## What I was doing up to 2020...

For the most part, working as an IT professional in various roles ranging from classic Moss and Roy style tech support - to information security management.

## How I got from there to here (The Long Story)...

We spend a lot of time at our job. It took me a long time to realise that finding something meaningful that feeds my soul and keeps me excited to start in a morning should be my only career goal. I'm no renaissance man by any stretch, but my interests lie across a bunch of different disciplines and It's amazing how many of these I get to explore when developing for the web.

I built my first web site when I was 15 years old, a Slipknot fan site hosted on Angelfire or GeoCities or something like that. I built a few other sites like this as well as a few Flash games, and I had a hoot doing it. I have no idea to this day why I didn't think of making a living from it. I'd have been better off just ditching education at that point and striking out as a freelancer. Alas, I did not.

I listened too much to outside voices and ended up studying architecture. I had a ton of fun with the design and practical parts, but I couldn't see myself as an architect long-term, so I dropped out. I switched track to train as a commercial artist but that period in my life was mired by financial problems this led me taking on more hours working in a warehouse alongside study, which ultimately just led to burn-out and my studies being derailed.

Third time's the charm? I had a break, hit reset, and signed up to an interactive multimedia course (basically rolling up graphic design, animation and web - there was a heavy focus on Macromedia Shockwave - Ha! Remember that?). Unfortunately, my local authority pulled my tuition fee funding so that was over more or less as it began.

Thus ensued the next {new Date().getFullYear() - new Date(1999, 8).getFullYear()} years or so. I just did jobs to pay the bills; warehousing, merchandising, destroying part of my soul in a call centre, working in IT support, IT service management and IT security.

It wasn't until late-2019 when my workplace ran a voluntary redundancy scheme I did what any self-respecting, successful, Information Security Professional would do - and threw it all in to start again.

And so I returned to my first love of dicking around creating things with computers. After enough dicking around building stuff I landed a job with an agency as a Junior Developer.

I don't regret arriving into my chosen profession by way of the scenic route. If anything, all the experiences I've had and all the people I've met and worked with along the way shape my approach and perspectives as a developer. It also gave Internet Explorer the chance to die and go away forever ðŸ˜† (Safari, these are not shoes you should aim to fill).
