# Hello!

I'm a developer and creative based in the UK.

I love what I do. I do it for money. I do it for fun. And it nearly gets me to the end of level baddie in Maslow's Pyramid.

Welcome to this site. It's built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com). I take a digital gardening approach to its design and maintenance. Like my actual garden, I don't get as much time to spend on it as I'd like and some bits may go to wrack and ruin whilst I'm putting in a new birdbath. Like my actual garden, people are welcome to visit and enjoy it, but it's mostly for me - if I want to put a hideous gnome in the flower bed - then I will.
