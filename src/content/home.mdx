# Hello!

I'm a front-end developer and all-round creative based in the UK.

I love what I do. I love that I get better at it every day. I love that peeps give me money to do it (I even do it for free ðŸ¤«). I love that it nearly gets me to the end of level baddie in Maslow's Pyramid.

To keep the cash-money coming in, I build apps with React and TypeScript. When I'm not on the clock, I'll build with whatever takes my fancy (code or otherwise). Right now, that's mostly [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and plywood (as in the actual wood, not this [JS library](https://plywood.imply.io/) - who knew!).

welcome to this site. It's built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com). I take a digital gardening approach to its design and maintenance. Like my actual garden, I don't get as much time to spend on it as I'd
like and some bits may go to wrack and ruin whilst I'm putting in a new birdbath. Like my actual garden, people are welcome to visit and enjoy it, but it's mostly for me - if I want to put a hideous gnome in
the flower bed - then I will.
