For a long time now I've wanted to create a collection of games inspired by some of the classics that had an impact on me growing up.

There's a few motivations for this one.

I'd love to start building games prolifically, and this felt like a solid start to that.

The 80s and 90s covers a pretty fat slice of gaming history. It felt like it could be a great opportunity to reflect on some the games that had a big impact on me growing up.

It's been a long time since I've worked on any creative projects. Just having fun emulating a range of art and music styles will definitely grease the wheels so I'm less rusty when I start on my first "proper" game.

As we travelled towards the millennium, games grew in scope and complexity. If I work chronologically with these homages I'm hoping my capabilities grow in accordance with complexity of the projects.

Degas quote - I'm hoping each serves as a masterclass in game design.

First one, _**Rambo: First Blood Part II**_
