I trained myself as a developer by building games. Since then I've had this ambition to build a series of games paying homage to certain gems I recall from my gaming life.

There's a few motivations for this one.

First, I'd love it more than anything to make a living from building games. As a step toward that, I thought this would be a pretty cool project to learn the craft properly. A reet proper deep-dive.

Second, my first gaming memories hazily come in to view in the ZX Spectrum era. If I approach this project chronologically, the scope, ambition and complexity of each should increase as I travel forward through time. Hopefully in line with my capabilities.

Third, spending a decade in IT has really dried up them creative juices. Emulating a bunch of different art and music styles should really lube up that dried out part of grey matter.

So following all of this project, I hope to draw a radish... from nature.
