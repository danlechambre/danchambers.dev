Having recently left my role as a developer with an agency. It got me to thinking about what my ideal role looks like. I'm realistic in that my next job won't necessarily tick off all of these boxes, but I'll be looking to make sure I get the lion's share.

Without further ado, my Ideal Role&trade; *probably* looks something like this:

- **Work to my passion and strengths** &mdash; I'm a front-end engineer. It's my favourite and best. I love CSS. I love JavaScript. I love the web platform. I'd love to go "full-stack" at some point, but only within the JS ecosystem I've grown to love. I'm sure Java is great and all, but I'm just not in to it.

- **Variety** &mdash; I do this work because I love it - not just to count the hours and take a wage - so I want a variety of problems to solve and challenges to work through to keep me engaged.

- **Investment** &mdash; I enjoy being a product-minded developer, keeping an eye on the big picture and sharing in a collective vision.

- **Make an impact** &mdash; I've only worked on one mothballed app. But that's enough to know I want my work to actually mean something and affect the world in some tiny way. It doesn't have to be huge, but the impact has to be real.

- **Work anywhere** &mdash; I'm a developer. I need only a laptop and minimal distractions to do my work. So I want to be free to work wherever I like.

- **Work anytime** &mdash; same as above but relating to locations in the 4th dimension. If I give 36 hours. Does it really matter when they happen?

- **Give me a Mac** &mdash; or let me use my own. Please don't make me set up Node on Windows again, it just makes me a sad panda üêº.
